# Lely core libraries

The Lely core libraries are a collection of C and C++ libraries and tools,
providing hih-performance I/O and sensor/actuator control for robotics and IoT
applications. The libraries are cross-platform and have few dependencies. They
can be even be used on bare-metal microcontrollers with as little as 32 kB RAM.

## Overview

The Lely core libraries consist of:
- C11 and POSIX compatibility library (liblely-libc)
- Test Anything Protocol (TAP) library (liblely-tap)
- Utilities library (liblely-util)
- Event library (liblely-ev)
- Asynchronous I/O library (liblely-io2)
- CANopen library (liblely-co)
- C++ CANopen application library (liblely-coapp)

## Getting started

### Download

Pre-built Debian packages are available on our
[Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~lely/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).

You can download the source code from the
[Releases](https://gitlab.com/lely_industries/lely-core/-/releases) page, or
clone this repository with

    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/lely_industries/lely-core.git

### Build and install

This project uses the GNU Build System (`configure`, `make`, `make install`),
available on Linux and Windows (through [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)). To
build the libraries and tools, you need to install  the autotools (autoconf,
automake and libtool). After the initial clone or download of the source,
generate the `configure` script by running

    $ autoreconf -i

in root directory of the project. This step only has to be repeated if
`configure.ac` or one the the `Makefile.am` files changes.

First, configure the build system by running

    $ ./configure --disable-python

If you do not want to clutter the source directories with object files, you can
run `configure` from another directory. `--disable-python` disables the
deprecated Python bindings. The `configure` script supports many other options.
The full list can be shown with

    $ ./configure --help

and is documented
[here](https://opensource.lely.com/canopen/docs/configuration/).

Once the build system is configured, the libraries and tools can be built with

    $ make

The optional test suite can be run with

    $ make check

If you have [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) and
[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) installed, you can build the HTML
documentation of the API with

    $ make html

Finally, install the binaries, headers and documentation by running

    # make install

as root.

information about building the Lely-core libraries from source, as well as
instructions for cross-compilation.
