/**@file
 * This header file is part of the utilities library; it contains the
 * single-producer, single-consumer ring buffer declarations.
 *
 * To make the ring buffer generic, a low-level interface is provided which only
 * operates on buffer indices. The user is responsible for reading or writing
 * values to an actual memory buffer (or file).
 *
 * The implementation allows both the producer and consumer to register a signal
 * function which is invoked once a requested number of indices becomes
 * available for reading or writing. This enables the user to implement blocking
 * read or write operations.
 *
 * All ring buffer operations are lock-free, provided the user-defined signal
 * functions are lock-free. If no signal functions are registered, the
 * operations are also wait-free.
