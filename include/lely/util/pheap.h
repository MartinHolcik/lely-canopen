/**@file
 * This header file is part of the utilities library; it contains the
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_heap">pairing heap</a>
 * declarations.
 *
 * A pairing heap is a half-sorted tree structure suitable for a priority queue.
 * Compared to a self-balancing binary tree, insertion and retrieval of the
 * first (minimum) element is faster (O(1) vs. O(log(n))), while finding an
 * arbitrary element is slower (O(n) vs. O(log(n))).
 *
 * The pairing heap implemented here is generic and can be used for any kind of
 * key-value pair; only (void) pointers to keys are stored. Upon initialization
 * of the heap, the user is responsible for providing a suitable comparison
 * function (#pheap_cmp_t).
