/**@file
 * This header file is part of the event library; it contains the fiber executor
 * declarations.
 *
 * The fiber executor ensures that each task runs in a fiber, or stackful
 * coroutine. Since it is platform-dependent whether fibers can be migrated
 * between threads, the (inner) executor from which the fibers are resumed MUST
 * be single-threaded.
 *
 * To limit the creation overhead, fibers are reused once they finish executing
 * a task. The implementation maintains a list of unused fibers, up to a
 * user-defined limit.
 *

/**
 * Initializes the calling thread for use by fiber executors. This function MUST
 * be invoked at least once in each thread that will resume a suspended fiber.
 * This function can be invoked more than once by the same thread. Only the
 * first invocation initializes the thread.
 *
 * @param flags      the flags used to initialize the internal fiber of the
 *                   calling thread (see fiber_thrd_init()) and any subsequent
 *                   fibers created by a fiber executor. <b>flags</b> can be any
 *                   supported combination of #FIBER_SAVE_MASK,
 *                   #FIBER_SAVE_FENV, #FIBER_SAVE_ERROR and #FIBER_GUARD_STACK.
 * @param stack_size the size (in bytes) of the stack frame to be allocated for
 *                   the fibers. If 0, the default size (#LELY_FIBER_STKSZ) is
 *                   used. The size of the allocated stack is always at least
 *                   #LELY_FIBER_MINSTKSZ bytes.
 * @param max_unused the maximum number of unused fibers kept alive for future
 *                   tasks. If 0, the default number (#LELY_EV_FIBER_MAX_UNUSED)
 *                   used.
 *
 * @returns 1 if the calling thread is already initialized, 0 if it has been
 * successfully initialized, or -1 on error. In the latter case, the error
 * number can be obtained with get_errc().
