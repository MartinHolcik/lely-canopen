/**@file
 * This header file is part of the event library; it contains the polling event
 * loop declarations.
 *
 * The polling event loop is an event loop suitable for use with asynchronous
 * I/O operations. It is typically used in a thread pool to execute the tasks
 * submitted to it through its associated executor. If no tasks are pending, the
 * event loop can optionally poll for external events (through the abstract
 * #ev_poll_t polling interface), such as I/O completion or readiness
 * notifications.
 *
 * The event loop does not create its own threads. It depends on the user to
 * execute one of the run functions (ev_loop_wait(), ev_loop_wait_until(),
 * ev_loop_wait_one(), ev_loop_wait_one_until(), ev_loop_run(),
 * ev_loop_run_until(), ev_loop_run_one(), ev_loop_run_one_until(),
 * ev_loop_poll() and ev_loop_poll_one()). If not explicitly stopped, these
 * functions will execute pending tasks as long as the event loop has
 * outstanding work. In this context, outstanding work is defined as the sum of
 * all pending and currently executing tasks, plus the number of calls to
 * ev_exec_on_task_init(), minus the number of calls to ev_exec_on_task_fini().
 * If, at any time, the outstanding work falls to 0, the event loop is stopped
 * as if by ev_loop_stop().

/**
 * Creates a new polling event loop.
 *
 * @param poll      a pointer to the polling instance to be used to poll for
 *                  events. If <b>poll</b> is NULL, the event loop does not
 *                  poll.
 * @param npoll     the maximum number of threads allowed to poll (i.e., invoke
 *                  `ev_poll_wait(poll, ...)` concurrently. If <b>npoll</b> is
 *                  0, there is no limit. If <b>poll</b> is NULL, this parameter
 *                  is ignored. On platforms supporting I/O completion ports
 *                  (Windows) it is generally most efficient to allow all
 *                  threads to poll (i.e., `npoll == 0`), while on platforms
 *                  using the reactor pattern (POSIX) it is best to allow a
 *                  single polling thread (`npoll == 1`).
 * @param poll_task if <b>poll_task</b> is non-zero, a polling task is queued to
 *                  the event loop and requeued when executed. This can prevent
 *                  starvation, since the event loop otherwise only polls if no
 *                  tasks are pending, which may never happen in CPU-bound
 *                  situations. Under light loads, however, the extra polling
 *                  overhead may harm performance. If <b>poll</b> is NULL, this
 *                  parameter is ignored.
 *
 * @returns a pointer to the new event loop, or NULL on error. In the latter
 * case, the error number can be obtained with get_errc().
